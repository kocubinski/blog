#+TITLE: Oh my emacs (and a promsise)

Finally a free Sunday, emacs hacking and [[http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx][yak shaving]] all day.  Couldn't be
happier.  There is quite bit of interesting work coming up for me, lots of fun
problems to solve, and solutions I will easily forget if I don't write them
down somewhere. Why not here?  It helps me remember, and may help someone else.  I'm
going to record more, I promise!

With several Clojure projects on the horizon, I decided to take a fresh look at
my emacs config.

Hmm, NOPE. ~mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.old~ it is.

After a bit of searching, I decided to try out [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]].  It uses the
solarized-dark theme *and* evil right of the box, great!

But of course I needed to make a few tweaks.  Oh my emacs uses ~el-get~ instead
of ELPA, which can be a bit buggy at times.  I ran into a few [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs/issues/56][problems]] during
installation, but they were easy enough to resolve.

Customizing/extending is easy though.  Oh-my-emacs will try to load all files
in the current ~emacs.d/$USER~ directory.  So far here is what I have so far in ~$HOME/emacs.d/binski/binski.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [(f10)] 'ido-switch-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-,") 'other-window)

(blink-cursor-mode -1)

(ome-install 'org2blog)

(require 'org2blog-autoloads)
(setq org2blog/wp-use-sourcecode-shortcode t)
(setq org2blog/wp-blog-alist
      '(("wordpress"
         :url "http://kocubinski.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php"
         :username "kocubinski"
         :default-title "Hello World"
         :default-categories ("emacs")
         :tags-as-categories nil)))
#+END_SRC

~ome-install~ installs/loads the ~org2blog~ package via el-get.  But it barfed
immediately because ~(org-version)~ was returning and empty string.  This was
because of this line in ~init.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; enable git shallow clone to save time and bandwidth
(setq el-get-git-shallow-clone t)
#+END_SRC

Which is now commented out in my [[https://github.com/kocubinski/oh-my-emacs/commit/441af8042688d79cc0d524c5ce8a5b96a712b8c6][fork]].  The tags weren't getting checkout out, and so no
version number was getting created when ~org-mode~ compiles.

Excited to see what else this awesome package has to offer.
