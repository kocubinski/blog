#+TITLE: emacs projectile-mode and another build

I'd been meaning to checkout [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile-mode]] for a bit now.  So I did, and it turns out its fantastic. In a
nutshell, what projectile does is introduce the abstraction of a project" (something which emacs lacks), and
allows you to run operations a collection of files / folders in said project.

One of my favorite features is ~projectile-grep~, which is global find in your current project.  But this was
happening:

Which makes it quite to hard to see what's going on.  Once again, this was [[https://github.com/kocubinski/emacs/commit/2e4c2fe2787785a421f256541de642976e9bd90b][fixed in emacs-25]].  I've pulled
this change into my emacs24 branch as well, and published a
[[http://kocubinski.com/dist/emacs-24.5-0603e75.7z][new build]].

And fixed:

Eventually I'll have to upgrade my ~.emacs.d~ to be 25 friendly, but not yet!
